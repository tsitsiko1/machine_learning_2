    "In this example we will use **Twitter** as our data source to filter those tweets that are talking about a given application. This is a typical problem in probabilistic classification, where I'll use a large sample of texts corresponding to the category that I want to recognize, and another large sample of texts unrelated to that category. That way, by exploring the different word frequencies and probabilities, we'll determine if a new text belongs to one or another category, by simply looking at the existing evidence.\n",
